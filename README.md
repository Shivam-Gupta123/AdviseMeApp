# Welcome to my AdviseMe App!

This app was created in order to help computer science students at the Ohio State University deal with the advisor crisis. The app provides a planned layout for all the classes that a computer science student must take for every fall and spring semester. The goal is to ease tension when scheduling classes and figuring out how to graduate on time. Enjoy!


## To run the project

You need to go to the website: https://nodejs.org/en and download node.js

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
